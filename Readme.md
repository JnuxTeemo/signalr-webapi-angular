# Asp.net Signalr

Used in a Web API (REST) and  Angular client

Project:
-Backend: Web Api
-Frontend: Angular with server lite

Compile and execute web Api with visual studio, then in a console, execute npm start for open frontend.

# USE CASES (See images to understand):
-Todo list: use 2 instances of client (different browsers)
-Chat: use with backend webpage and 1 client

Â¿Why chat can't be used in 2 clients? Yes you can!, but frontend uses browsersync,
 so if you click in one browser a button, the other browser will simulate too, and you will run all fuctionality twice! :(
